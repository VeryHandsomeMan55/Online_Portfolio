        <p class="col-sm-9">In 2004, I was born in rainy Portland, Oregon. I lived there for 5 years with two sisters, a potential girlfriend, and with my dad's large extended family. When my dad got tired of the rainy Oregon climate, he decided to move to warm, sunny California.In the past 8 or 9 years in California I am now around my mom's family (but I still don't have a girlfriend). I have friends 3 outside of school friend, all 3 in the engineering/math fields, (they are all in college). These 3 people influeced me to want to pursue a job in the engineering, a mechanical engineer.</p>
